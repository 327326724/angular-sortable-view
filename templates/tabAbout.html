<h3>About</h3>
<p>
	This is a simple library written as a module for <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js">AngularJS</a> for sorting elements in the UI. It supports both single elements list, and multiple connected lists, where an element can be moved from one to another.
</p>
<p>
	This library requires <b>no dependencies whatsoever</b> (except angular.js of course), so <b>you no longer need to include jQuery and jQueryUI and angularUI</b> which altogether gives the size of around <b class="danger">340kB minified!</b>. Whereas the <a href="https://github.com/kamilkp/angular-sortable-view">angular-sortable-view</a> is only <b class="success">5kB minified!</b>
</p>
<h3>API</h3>
<p>
	The API is declarative. There are four directives (hooked on attributes) that need to be nested properly:
	<ul class="list">
		<li><span class="syntax">sv-root</span></li>this is where all the logic is happening. If multiple lists should be connected with each other so that elements can be moved between them and they have a common ancestor, put this attribute on that element. If not and you still want the multi-sortable behaviour a value for that attribue must be provided. That value will be used as an identifier to connect those roots together. You can also add a <span class="syntax">sv-on-sort</span> attribute to that element. The expression passed as a value of that attribute will be evaluated when elements order has changed after sorting.
		<li><span class="syntax">sv-part</span></li>this attribute should be placed on an element that is a container for the <span class="syntax">ngRepeat</span>'ed elements. Its value should be the same as the right hand side expression in <span class="syntax">ng-repeat</span> attribute.
		<li><span class="syntax">sv-element</span></li>this attribute should be placed on the same element as <span class="syntax">ng-repeat</span> attribute. Its (optional) value should be an expression that evaluates to the options object.
		<li><span class="syntax">sv-handle</span></li>this attribute is optional. If needed it can be placed on an element within the sortable element. This element will be the handle for sorting operations.
		<li><span class="syntax">sv-helper</span></li>the element with this attribute will serve as a custom helper for sorting operations.
		<li><span class="syntax">sv-placeholder</span></li>the element with this attribute will serve as a custom placeholder for sorting operations.
	</ul>
